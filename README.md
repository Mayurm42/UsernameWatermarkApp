# Username Watermark Application

## Overview
The Username Watermark Application is a Windows Forms application that displays a semi-transparent watermark on the screen. This watermark contains the logged-in user's email alias and the current date and time. It is designed to be non-intrusive, allowing clicks to pass through to underlying applications.

## Features
- **Full-Screen Watermark**: The application runs in full-screen mode, covering the entire display with a watermark.
- **Dynamic Watermark**: Displays the logged-in user's email alias along with the current date and time.
- **Transparency**: The watermark is semi-transparent, allowing users to see the underlying applications.
- **Click-Through Functionality**: Users can interact with applications behind the watermark without interference.

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
3. Build and run the application.

## Usage
- The application will automatically retrieve the logged-in user's email alias and display it as a watermark.
- The watermark will be updated to reflect the current date and time.
- To close the application, use the standard window management shortcuts (Alt + F4).

## Considerations
- **Privacy**: Be mindful of using this application in public or shared environments, as it displays the user's email alias.
- **Compatibility**: This application is designed for Windows operating systems.
- **Performance**: Continuous rendering of the watermark may impact performance on lower-end machines.
